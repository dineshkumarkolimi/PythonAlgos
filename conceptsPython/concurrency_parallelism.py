# Concurrency can be achieved with threads. There are different ways to do this. 

# I/O-bound tasks:
# When tasks involve waiting for external resources (like disk I/O or network I/O), 
# using threads (threading, concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor) or asyncio can 
# significantly improve performance.

# CPU-bound tasks:
# When tasks involve heavy computations, using processes (multiprocessing, 
# concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor) can take advntage of multiple CPU cores for parallel processing

# Key Concepts
# Global Interpreter Lock (GIL): Pythonâ€™s GIL ensures that only one thread executes Python bytecode
# at a time, which limits the performance of CPU-bound multi-threaded applications. 
# To bypass this limitation, use multiprocessing.

# Event Loop: In asyncio, the event loop runs asynchronous tasks in an efficient, non-blocking manner.

# Summary
# Concurrency: Manage multiple tasks making progress over time (e.g., using threads or asyncio).
# Parallelism: Run multiple tasks at the same time on different CPU cores (e.g., using multiprocessing).
# Libraries: threading, multiprocessing, concurrent.futures, asyncio are the main libraries for handling concurrency and parallelism in Python.
# GIL: Limits CPU-bound multi-threaded performance; use multiprocessing to overcome it.
# Use Cases: Choose threading/asyncio for I/O-bound tasks and multiprocessing for CPU-bound tasks.

    for i in range(5):
        print(i)

def fetch_url(url):

# use concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor for multiprocesing
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as executor:
    futures = [executor.submit(fetch_url, url) for url in urls]
    
for future in as_completed(futures):
    print(future.result())
    
# third way
async def async_ex():
    for url in urls:
        result = await fetch_url()
        print(result)

asyncio.run(async_ex())


#Multiprocessing
import multiprocessing

# Here are some tips to help you get the best performance out of asyncio:

# 1. Leverage Non-blocking I/O Operations
# Ensure that all I/O operations (network requests, file operations, etc.) are non-blocking. 
# Use asyncio-compatible libraries like aiohttp for HTTP requests instead of synchronous libraries 
# like requests.

import aiohttp

async def fetch_data(session, url):
    async with session.get(url) as response:
        return await response.text()

async def aio_ex():
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        result = await fetch_data(session, 'www.google.com')
        print(result)
        
asynio.run(aio_ex())

# 2. Limit the Number of Concurrent Tasks
# While it's tempting to run a large number of tasks concurrently, doing so can overwhelm 
# the event loop and degrade performance. Use asyncio.Semaphore or asyncio.BoundedSemaphore 
# to limit the number of concurrent tasks

# 3. Use asyncio.gather for Parallel Tasks
# Use asyncio.gather() to run multiple coroutines concurrently and gather their results efficiently.

async def limited_tasks(sem, url):
    async with sem:
        return await fetch_url(url)   

async def semaphore_ex():
    sem = asyncio.Semaphore(5)
    tasks = [limited_tasks(sem, url) for url in urls]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    print(results)
    
# 3. Optimize Task Scheduling
# Use asyncio.create_task() to schedule tasks in the background without blocking the main flow.

# Profile and Monitor Performance
# Use tools like cProfile and asyncio-specific utilities to profile your application and 
# identify bottlenecks
import cProfile

async def task_ex():
    task = asyncio.create_task(semaphore_ex()) # this runs as a background task
    await task

cProfile.run('asyncio.run(task_ex())')
